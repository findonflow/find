## Testing

 - As the first test of a file always assert the happy day and use AutoGold to assert on relevant script/events in full. 
 - Do not use AutoGold Equal in following tests as Ids will be wrong if you run a single test. 
 - what to do with events vs scripts when we test? We need to ensure that atleast one test is also using scripts and not only events
