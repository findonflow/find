// This contract is probably the most confusing element of the FLOAT
// platform. Listed here is a bunch of Structs which all implement
// FLOAT.IVerifier. 

// This pattern allows us to define arbitrary "restrictions" or "verifiers"
// on our FLOAT Events. For example, Timelock is a verifier that makes sure
// the current time is within the start and end date that the FLOAT Event host
// specified when they created an event.  

// The cool part is all of these verifiers are totally optional, and are only
// passed in with the newly created event if the host wanted to enable them.  
// You can mix and match them however you want. For example, one event I could
// use both Timelock and Limited, and for another event I could just use Secret.  

// Each verifier must have a `verify` function that takes in a generalized `params`
// argument so we can pass user data through as well as info about the event itself.  
// This is important for Secret for example because we want to pass the users guess
// of the secret code through. For Limited, we need to know the totalSupply of the event,
// so we pass it through as well.
